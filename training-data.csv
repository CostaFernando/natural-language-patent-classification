"A film that contains a core layer positioned adjacent to an outer layer is provided. The core layer contains a relatively high percentage of thermoplastic biopolymers that are both biodegradable and renewable. Despite being biodegradable and renewable, many biopolymers tend to be relatively stiff in nature.
