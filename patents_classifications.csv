     providing increased tensile strength to the film. Although providing a
     good combination of biodegradability/renewability and increased tensile
     strength, the polylactic acid is also relatively rigid and can result in
     films having a relatively high stiffness (e.g., high modulus of
     elasticity) and low ductility. While more ductile than polylactic acid,
     the thermoplastic starch is often difficult to melt process in film
     forming processes and very sensitive to moisture and water vapor,
     reducing its ability to be used as a stand alone packaging film. In an
     effort to counteract the effect of such polymers, an aliphatic-aromatic
     copolyester is also employed in the blend of the present invention. While
     such copolyesters are biodegradable, they also possess the melt
     properties and ductility that lend them well to the formation of films.
     Although the combination of these polymers may achieve a good balance
     between biodegradability/renewability, high tensile strength, and good
     ductility (e.g., high peak elongation), it is still often difficult to
     achieve a precise set of mechanical properties as desired for packaging
     films. In this regard, the blend also contains a filler. Due to its rigid
     nature, the amount of the filler may be readily adjusted to fine tune the
     blend to the desired degree of ductility (e.g., peak elongation) and
     stiffness (e.g., modulus of elasticity).',produto
8227658,'A film that is formed from a biodegradable polymer blend of different
     aliphatic-aromatic copolyesters is provided. More specifically, the blend

     use of a terephthalic acid monomer results in a polymer chain containing
     1,4-(para-) terephthalate units linked in a generally linear
     configuration (e.g., .about.180.degree.). The blend also contains a
     second aliphatic-aromatic copolyester formed from a phthalic acid and/or
     isophthalic acid monomer. The use of such a monomer results in a polymer
     chain containing 1,2-(ortho-) and/or 1,3-(meta-) linked units. The
     inclusion of 1,2-(ortho-) and/or 1,3-(meta-) linked units into the
     polymer backbone of the second copolyester introduces an angle or "kink"
     (e.g., .about.120.degree. kink for a 1,3-linkage) into the otherwise
     linear polymer chain. The "kinks" in the second copolyester backbone
     reduce its melting point and degree of crystallinity, which have an
     influence on its physical properties (e.g., toughness, tensile strength,
     and crystallization rate). Thus, the physical properties of the second
     copolyester may differ substantially from those of the first copolyester.
     In this regard, the "kinked" second copolyester can provide flexibility

     used: a polymeric hydrogel formed of a material such as alginate having

     spacing between about 100 and 300 microns. Preferred polymeric materials
     are those degrading over about one to two months, such as polylactic

     implantation or implanted, allowed to vascularize, then seeded with cells.
     In a preferred embodiment, the cell-matrix structures are implanted in

     cells proliferate and form new tissue, the expander size is decreased,
